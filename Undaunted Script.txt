NPC: Hello Adventurer, are you interested in joining the Undaunted?

Player: What is the Undaunted?

NPC: The Undaunted in ages past were the strongest group of adventurers in Tamriel. They travelled the world completing Bounties.

Player: Bounties?

NPC: Evil exists all over this land in many forms. We took it upon ourselves to root it out. Now, however our numbers are few.

Player: Can I Help?

NPC: The Undaunted welcome any and all to our ranks. Becoming one of us grants the ability to rout out nearby evil.

Player: How do I find nearby evil?

NPC: I will grant you the power to locate nearby Bounties. Complete a few and you will be rewarded.

Player: Rewarded?

NPC: Yes, you will be given Undaunted Reward Keys. Our members have travelled far and wide and we have weapons, armour and items to spare.
