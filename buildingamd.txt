Making a micro dungeon

Create a new cell.

Create your dungeon. It should be reasonably short, maybe 1/2 fights. 
Personally I just copy and paste from preexisiting places.

Duplicate the BanditCaeEnterance amd Exit

Change the ResetCellRef in the script properties to the Cell you created.
Change the TargetRef to a marker at the enterance of your dungeon.
Leave exitRed alone.

Place the Exit in your dungeon. Make it fairly obvious what the player needs to do.

Find the formid of your new Enterance in the object window for example:

0408D8F5

That the load order off the value, in this example it's 04 so we end up with 

08D8F5

Convert the hex to dec. Loads of tools can do this or just google it.

You end up with 579829

Create a bounty using this value as a scripted door:

[
    [
        ["Clear out the Bandit Cave","Skyrim.esm",0,0],
        ["01_Undaunted_InvisibleNPC","Undaunted.esp",309411,"Placer"],
        ["1_Undaunted_BanditCaveEnterance","Undaunted.esp",579829,"ScriptedDoor","Architecture/Farmhouse/Interior/Basement/FarmBTrapdoor02.nif"]
    ]
]

And that's it. Test out your microdungeon!
